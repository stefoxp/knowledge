# Kanban principles

Kanban is like a metaprocess that can be applied to whatever process you're working with today.
No new processes, no new rules, and no troublesome reorganisations needed.

## The principles of kanban

1. Visualize
2. Limit work in process
3. Manage flow

With a visualized workflow, a limit for the WIP, and a focus on moving work through your workflow, you have set yourself up to easily spot improvement opportunities.

David Anderson has extended the three basic principles to five properties and later to six practices (core practices):

1. Visualize
2. Limit work in process
3. Manage flow
4. Make process policies explicit
5. Implement feedback loops
6. Improve collaboratively, evolve experimentally (using model and the scientific method)

David Anderson uses principles to describe some other principles:

- Start where you are
- Agree to pursue incremental, evolutionary change
- Initially, respect current roles, responsabilities, and job titles
- Leadership at all levels in the organization

>Make sure you draw the board together as a team

1. Start by visualizing your work. Ex: create a sticky for each work item and place it anywhere on a whiteboard
2. Map your workflow to the board. Ex: create a column for each stage in your workflow. Move the tickets into the correct columns.
3. Make a couple of dry runs with some work that has passed through your workflow to see that the workflow actually matches the way you work. Change as needed.
4. Decide on a work-in-process limit
5. For extra measure, create some avatars and attach them to the things you're working on now
