# Team Kanbaneros get started

## The board (Visualizing work)

- Makes hidden work apparent
  - Can be as easy as a sticky for each work item
- Helps you see:
  - Who's working on what
  - What you're working on
  - How much is going on
- Visible work radiates information to people seeing it

## Mapping the workflow

- Identify all the stages, from work entering to work leaving the team
- Don't strive for perfection
  - Inspect and adapt
- Work ins't done until it's producing value to the customer
- With a visualized workflow you can see:
  - Status of work
  - Potential problems such as work not progressing and piling up in a stage

## Work items

What goes on the card?

- From the card you should:
  - See the status of the work item
  - Be able to form a decision about what to do next with it
- Common attributes are:
  - Description of the work item
  - ID in electronic systems
  - Deadlines
  - Who's working on the item
  - Type of work (bug or normal, for example)

## Pass the Pennies

1. Work in process (WIP) is the number of work items you have going at the same time. Less work in process leads to quicker flow through your process: shorter lead time.
2. Optimizing your process for quicker flow can lead to poorer resource utilization.

Limit work in process

- Strive to work with fewer items at the same time
- Smaller batches means shorter lead times
- Resource efficiency decreases while flow efficiency increases
- Game/simulations like Pass the Pennies can be a great way to teach people abstract concepts

## Work in process

>The WIP limit isn't a strict rule; it's a trigger for discussions.

Limit your work in process:

- Start with: stop starting and start finishing
- Limiting WIP will surface improvement opportunities
  - Acting on them leads to better flow
- There's no one right WIP limit for a team
- A lower WIP is generally better. As a rule of thumb:
  - Too-high WIP leaves work idle
  - Too-low WIP leaves people idle
- WIP limits are not rules; they are triggers for discussions

## Expedite items

Expedite lane:

- Common way to handle special cases
  - Such as work that is urgent
- Often visualized as a separate lane on the board
- Policies around that lane might be:
  - Only one item can be in the lane at the time
  - Max one expedite item per week
  - Don't count the expedite lane against the WIP limit

## Metrics

- There to help the team improve
- Let the team choose their own metrics; do not use them for performance review
- Two common and useful metrics are:
  - **Lead Time** is the time for the whole workflow
  - **Throughput** is how much or how many work items you complete over a period of time
