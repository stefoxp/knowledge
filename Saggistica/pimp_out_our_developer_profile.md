## 1 . Contribute to Open Source

Use the power of GitHub to meet like-minded developers and create new projects you want to work on.

## 2. Showcase your Open Source contributions

Make sure to keep the things you're proud of where they're easy to see.
Start with **GitHub**, it's a social network:

- add a proper profile image
- write a cool and funny description about yourself
- pick a few repos you're particularly proud of and pin them to your GitHub profile
- star what you like
- follow developers who inspire you

You can also use tools witch use the GitHub APIs to visualize your contributions:

- [SourceRer.io](https://www.sourcerer.io)
- GitHub Profile Summary

## 3. Teach others

Teaching others will solidify your own knowledge in a subject and you're educating the next generation of developers.
Learning how to teach can be a big part of your progress as an individual and a developer.

## 4. Talk at events

Talking is a skill, and like coding, it can be mastered with practice.

## 5. Document everything

Use smart social networks like **Linkedin** and **Twitter**.
Add to your Linkedin profile:

- everything I mentioned above
- every job and volunteering gig
- every event you spoke at
- every lecture you may have taught
- **all relevant links** to your GitHub, Medium, blog, personal website...

Use Twitter as a timeline for your progress:

- post your progress on a regular basis
- tell people about the things you're working on
- es. #100DaysOfCode challenge
